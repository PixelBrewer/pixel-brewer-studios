          I mainly code Angular apps, like this one, and .NET web api's with
          some Azure functions as well. I take pride in creating clean,
          maintainable applications that are able to help people achieve the
          goals they set out to accomplish. Below you will find a list of my
          past work experiences in chronological order, some skills I have
          acquired over the years, my education, as well as a few of my hobbies
          and interests.

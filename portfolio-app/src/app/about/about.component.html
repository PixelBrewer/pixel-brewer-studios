        Hello and welcome to my cafe. I am your pixel barista. Why don't we brew
        up some coffee and discuss why I should be your next hire. Where to
        begin? I have a passion for all things in tech, especially writing code
        and solving problems. Currently I am employed as a Software Developer at
        a credit union called STCU. STCU is one of Washington state's largest
        credit unions and I am proud to work on projects that impact large
        volumes of members and thier finances.

        I am a full stack developer with experience in Angular, and .NET Core.
        However, this is not my only area of focus. Lately Golang and Python
        have been my languages of choice to tinker with on side projects.
